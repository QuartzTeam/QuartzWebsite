# TUF

Browse [The Universal Forums](https://tuforums.com/) community level database without leaving A Dance of Fire and Ice: search levels and level packs, download a level in one click, and play it straight away in the editor.

## Where to find it

Open the Quartz menu in-game and select **TUF** from the sidebar. It has three pages: **Levels**, **Packs**, and **Settings**.

## Levels

A searchable, endlessly scrolling list of TUF levels. Each card shows the level's ID, difficulty, song, artist, creator, clears, and likes. With **Level Previews** on, a blurred thumbnail from the level's video sits behind each card.

- **Search** — filter by song, artist, or creator. Results update as you type.
- **Sorting** — **Recent**, **Difficulty**, **Clears**, or **Likes**, each ascending or descending via the arrow chip.
- **Difficulty range** — a P→G→U gradient bar; drag the two handles to bound the difficulty range.
- **Quantum** — an opt-in second range bar for quantum difficulties. Turn it off and it folds away entirely.
- **Special** — a flyout with **Unranked**, **Censored**, and **Impossible** checkboxes for including special-difficulty levels.
- **Installed** — switches the list to your own library; see [Your library](#your-library) below.
- **Updates** — checks every level you've downloaded against TUF and tells you how many have a newer version waiting. Quartz also runs this check on its own once a day, so the count is usually already there. Once updates are waiting the chip reads **Update all**, and pressing it queues every one of them.
- **Grid View** — lays the levels out as a grid of cards instead of one long column. The number of columns follows the window width as you resize, and the choice sticks between sessions.
- Scrolling near the bottom loads the next page automatically.

### Downloading and playing

The button on each card walks through the whole flow: **Download** fetches and unpacks the level, then turns into **Load**, which opens the chart directly in the editor — no manual file handling. If an archive contains several playable charts, a chooser lists them so you can pick.

You don't have to wait for one download to finish before starting the next. Press **Download** on another level and it joins a queue, showing **Queued** with its place in line; pressing it again takes it back out. Only launching a level holds the rest of the list.

**Load** works from anywhere, including the middle of a run. If you're playing a level when you press it, Quartz leaves play mode for you and opens the new chart in the editor you were already in.

Some cards are the game's own built-in levels rather than downloads. These show **Play**, which opens the real in-game level directly, or **Buy DLC** — opening the store page — when the chart belongs to DLC you don't own.

!!! note
    Downloads come only from TUF's own servers over HTTPS, and archives are checked during extraction — unsafe entries are rejected. Downloaded levels are cached, so loading a level again is instant.

!!! tip "Unsaved editor changes"
    If the level open in the editor has changes you haven't saved, Quartz asks before replacing it. **Save** writes the level and carries on loading, **Discard** throws the changes away and carries on, and **Cancel** leaves everything exactly as it was.

Levels can be big — a heavily decorated one runs to hundreds of megabytes of backgrounds — so there's no fixed size limit. Quartz checks the free space on whichever drive your library lives on instead, and if a level genuinely won't fit it says how much it needs and how much you have before downloading anything.

## Your library

The **Installed** chip on the Levels page turns the list into everything you've downloaded, newest first. It reads a local index rather than the network, so it works with no connection, and search, sorting, and the difficulty filters all keep working over your own levels.

When TUF can't be reached at all — no connection, or the site times out — the Levels and Packs pages say so instead of showing a bare error, and offer a one-click switch to your installed levels, with the number you have on it, next to **Retry**.

- **Installed badge** — levels you already have are marked wherever they appear, including in search results and inside packs.
- **Delete** — the trash icon removes a level from disk, so clearing out maps doesn't mean digging through folders. It takes two clicks: the first arms the button and turns it red, the second deletes. Anything you remove can be downloaded again later.
- **Update** — each downloaded level carries a badge that asks TUF whether the chart has been re-uploaded since you got it. It reads **Up to date** when nothing has changed, and **Update** when a newer version is waiting; clicking it downloads that version over the copy you have.
- **Restore** — updating doesn't throw the old chart away. Quartz keeps the last three copies of a level in a `rollback` folder inside your levels folder, and **Restore** lists them by date so you can put an earlier one back.
- Levels downloaded before Quartz kept this index still show up, and they fill their own details in: Quartz reads the song, artist, and creator out of the chart file itself, and asks TUF about anything still missing. Creator names come from the level's credits, so charters credited there are named rather than left blank.

## Packs

Community level packs, in their own sub-tab.

- **Pack list** — search packs by name and sort by **Recent**, **Name**, or **Levels**. Each card shows the pack's name, level count, owner, favorites, and a preview of its first songs.
- **Open a pack** — click a card to see its levels. Packs keep their on-site **folder tree**: folders are collapsible rows showing how many levels they hold, with their contents indented beneath.
- **Level sorting** — inside a pack, switch between **Pack Order** (the curator's exact layout), **Difficulty**, and **Clears**. Sorting keeps the folder tree intact: levels reorder within each folder while the folders themselves stay in place.
- Levels in a pack download and play exactly like the Levels page, and share the same download cache.

## Settings

Controls for the browser's appearance and where your downloaded levels live. The page shows the folder currently in use at the top, under **Level Library**, along with how many levels you have and how much disk space they take up.

- **Level Previews** — show the blurred thumbnail behind each level and pack card, taken from the level's YouTube video (a pack falls back to its own icon). On by default; turn it off to skip the thumbnail downloads entirely.
- **Open Levels Folder** — opens the library actually in use in your file browser, which isn't the default one once you've moved it.
- **Change Levels Folder** — pick an empty folder to keep levels in, on a roomier drive for instance. Levels you already downloaded are moved there for you, with progress shown on the page.
- **Use the Default Folder** — moves everything back into Quartz's own folder inside the mod directory.
- **Link to TUFHelperLite Directories** — if you also run the TUFHelperLite mod, save downloaded levels straight into its `Downloads` folder (each named `tuf-<id>`) so both mods share one level library. This setting only appears when TUFHelperLite is actually installed; Quartz looks for it in the game's `UMMMods` folder first, then `Mods`.

!!! note "The folder has to be empty"
    Quartz manages everything inside the levels folder, so it won't take over one that already holds your own files, and it won't accept a whole drive. If a pick is rejected, the page says why.

!!! note
    The TUFHelperLite link wins over a folder you picked: while it's on, levels install into that mod's folder and **Change Levels Folder** is declined. Turn the link off first if you want your own folder back.

Moving a large library takes a moment and runs in the background, so the game keeps responding. Each level is recorded as it lands, so if a move is interrupted every level stays loadable wherever it actually ended up.
