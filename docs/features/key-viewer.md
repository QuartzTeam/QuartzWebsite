# Key Viewer

An on-screen key display with per-key press counters, KPS (keys per second), and a total counter — built in a free-form layout editor where every element is dragged, resized, and styled directly on a canvas. It speaks DM Note's preset format natively, so existing DM Note presets import losslessly, and it has its own `.qkv` format for carrying a whole setup between Quartz installs. You can use it inside full Quartz or install the [standalone Key Viewer](../install.md#standalone-key-viewer).

## Where to find it

In full Quartz, open the menu in-game and select **Overlay → Key Viewer** from the sidebar. The standalone edition opens directly to the same Key Viewer page.

## The layout editor

The editor is a zoomable canvas with the live key viewer on it:

- **Move and arrange** — drag elements anywhere, resize from the handles, and multi-select with a marquee or ++shift++-click. Dragging snaps to the grid and to neighbouring elements, with alignment guides while you move; holding ++shift++ locks the drag to one axis.
- **Canvas navigation** — scroll to pan, or drag with the middle or right mouse button. Press ++plus++ and ++minus++ to zoom, ++0++ for actual size, and **Fit** to frame the whole layout. Arrow keys nudge the selection; ++delete++ removes it.
- **Add elements** — **Add Key**, **Add Stat** (KPS, average and max KPS, total), and **Add Graph** (a live KPS line or bar graph).
- **Built-in styles** — the **Style** selector seeds a tab from a preset layout, from small key rows up to a full **108 Keys** keyboard, as a starting point to rearrange and restyle.
- **Inspector** — the panel beside the canvas styles whatever is selected, in tabs: **Element** (position, size, binding), **Rain**, **Counter**, **Style**, and **Settings**. Select several elements to edit their shared properties at once.
- **Color controls** — select any color row to open a compact popup with a color wheel, a direct hex field, and RGB or HSV channel sliders. In full Quartz, **Wide color picker** on the main **Settings** page puts the wheel and controls side by side for shorter displays.
- **Per-key input** — **Rebind Key** captures a new binding with a click, **Set Ghost Key** gives an element a secondary key for ghost rain, and **Count Toward Total** is per-element.
- **Element images** — the **Style** tab's **Image** section swaps an element's box for a picture, given a file path, `file://`/`http(s)://` URL, or `data:` URI (web images download once and are cached, and the picture is clipped to the element's shape). A separate **Image While Pressed** swaps in a second picture only while the key is held. **Cover**, **Contain**, **Stretch**, and **None** control how the picture fills the shape.
- **Disabled** stops an element from drawing in game and from counting presses, without removing it from the layout. Disabled elements dim on the canvas but stay selectable there, so you can turn them back on.
- **Labels and counters, per element** — **Show Label** turns an element's label off so the counter spreads over the whole box, leaving the box, border, and rain untouched. **Label While Pressed (empty = same)** gives a key a second label shown only while it's held. **Show Counter While Pressing** (on the **Counter** tab) hides the counter for as long as the key is down and brings it back on release, keeping its space reserved so nothing shifts.
- **Tabs** — keep several layouts side by side (each with its own **Tab Name**) and switch between them. The toolbar carries two strips: **Hand** tabs are your key layouts, and **Foot** tabs hold foot keys. One of each can be active at a time, and whichever you aren't editing shows through as a ghost on the canvas so you can line the two up.
- **Foot keys** — the foot button on the **Foot** strip builds a foot tab with the count you pick (or **None** to switch the foot keys off). In game the foot keys are their own panel, dragged anywhere in Reorganize mode independently of the hand keys, with their own **Foot Scale**, **Foot Offset X**, and **Foot Offset Y**. Foot presses light up but don't count toward the total.
- **Undo/redo** — every edit is undoable; held nudges coalesce into a single step.

!!! note "Coming from an older Quartz"
    The previous Simple and DM Note modes are gone. Your existing setup — either mode — is converted into an editor layout automatically the first time this version runs, and **Migrate** can re-run that conversion on demand.

## Rain

- **Note Rain** — streaks rise from a key while it's held, with speed, track height, fade, and reverse direction controls.
- **Ghost rain** — a separate streak for an element's ghost key, solid or dashed/dotted with adjustable dot and gap length.
- **Note length follows the press** — a streak is exactly as long as you held the key, so a quick tap and a longer hold are visibly different.
- **Delayed notes** — optionally hold back very short presses so quick taps still draw a readable streak.
- **Rounded borders** — a streak drawn with a border and a corner radius gets rounded corners instead of square ones.

## Key input

- **Independent Key Input** — read presses as keyboard events carrying the moment they happened, rather than checking the keyboard once per frame. A tap too quick to fall inside a frame still registers, and a note keeps the length you actually held it for. Quartz falls back to the per-frame reading on its own whenever the key hook isn't running or the game window isn't focused, so nothing stops working if it can't be used.
- **Minimum Lit Time** — hold a key lit for at least this long, so a very short tap is still visible instead of flashing by. Set it to 0 to light keys for exactly as long as they're held.

## Hiding your tapping pattern

**This Tabub Is Mine** stops anyone watching from reading your tapping pattern off the key viewer. Past a point in the level, the note rain stops and a picture drops over the boxes, covering the part of a run where the pattern is worth copying.

- **Hide Tabub From** — how far into the level the picture takes over. It fades in over the second leading up to that point and fades back out over the level's last second.
- **Custom Tabub Image** — pick your own picture. **Use Built-in Image** goes back to the one that ships with the mod.
- **Tabub Image Size** scales the picture, and you drag it into place in Reorganize mode like any other overlay. **Reset Tabub Position** puts it back.

Presses keep counting underneath the whole time, so nothing is lost from your counters, and everything returns to normal on the next attempt.

## Saving and sharing layouts

- **Import** — load a Quartz `.qkv` or a DM Note preset JSON straight into a layout tab, including any custom CSS and embedded images the preset carries; embedded pictures are checked and decoded safely before they render. **Open Presets Folder** jumps to where they live.
- **Export .qkv (Quartz)** — Quartz's own format: the layout *and* every Key Viewer setting, including your press counts. This is the one to send someone else running Quartz, or to carry a setup to another install.
- **Export .json (DM Note)** — a plain DM Note preset, for sharing with DM Note users. Anything DM Note has no concept of — ghost keys, pressed labels, per-key KPS, foot-row markers, note shadows, press scaling, and the rest — can't come along, and the export names exactly what it left behind rather than dropping it quietly.
- Both exports carry your pictures with them: an element image that points at a file on your disk is embedded into the export itself, so the layout looks the same on the receiving machine. Web URLs stay as links, and the export tells you if a file couldn't be read or was too large to embed.
- **Custom CSS** — layer a DM Note custom CSS file over the layout. Quartz ships its own CSS engine for this, so existing DM Note skins keep working. Skins that pull fonts or images from the web now download them through a capped, time-limited fetcher, so a huge or hung download can't stall the game.
- **KPS graph** — skins can declare a live line or bar graph through the CSS `--graph-*` variables. The graph spans the full time window set by `--graph-speed` (500–5000 ms).

## JavaScript plugins

The **JavaScript Plugins** section is in the editor's **Settings** inspector tab. It runs DM Note-style `.js` and `.mjs` plugins that can add declarative HTML, CSS, or SVG panels, react to keyboard input, read live stats, use timers, and keep private plugin data.

- **Enable JavaScript Plugins** controls the whole engine and is off by default. Turn it off to pause every imported plugin without removing any of them.
- **Import JavaScript Plugin** copies the selected file into your Key Viewer settings, enables JavaScript, and enables that plugin. Reopen **Settings** to see its individual toggle.
- **Reload Plugin Files** reads each original file path again, so edits made to those files replace the copies stored in Key Viewer.
- **Remove All Plugins** removes every imported plugin. Private data created by those plugins remains isolated on disk.

!!! warning
    Only import JavaScript plugins you trust. Quartz limits each plugin in a sandbox with no browser DOM, Node.js, network API, or CLR bridge, but a plugin is still code.

## Key Limiter sync

Key Viewer works without [Key Limiter](key-limiter.md), including keys that only the input hook can see. When the Key Limiter module is loaded in full Quartz, **Sync Keys to Key Limiter** appears and overwrites its allowed keys with the keys shown in the viewer. It keeps them matched when you rebind keys or switch layouts, while blocked keys still render as full presses in the viewer. The same toggle sits on the Key Limiter page too.

The standalone edition does not include Key Limiter, so it does not show this toggle.
