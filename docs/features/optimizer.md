# Optimizer

Performance toggles for smoother frame times and faster load-to-load cycles.

## Where to find it

Open the Quartz menu in-game and pick **Tweaks → Optimizer** from the sidebar.

## Highlights

- **Smooth GC** — keeps garbage-collection pauses from landing mid-run and nudging your timing. What it does depends on your game build: where the runtime already spreads collection across frames, Smooth GC leaves it alone, because that is already smooth; otherwise it reserves a collection-free budget for the run, which recovers on its own — before the run ends if it has to — rather than risk running out of memory. Collection is never switched off outright. Best paired with **Clean Heap On Load**.
- **Fix Game Memory Leaks** — patches known memory leaks in A Dance of Fire and Ice itself: decoration render textures and materials that survive level unloads, frame-rate-effect screen buffers, workshop thumbnails, practice-mode waveforms, and internal caches that only ever grow. Cuts RAM creep during long sessions.
- **Clean Heap On Load** — runs a collection on every scene load, so each run starts from a clean heap. The load screen already hitches, so this collection is effectively free.
- **Boost Process Priority** — asks the OS for more consistent CPU time (Above Normal priority). Takes effect on Windows; ignored where the system doesn't allow it, usually macOS/Linux.
- **Run In Background** — keeps the game running at full speed when its window loses focus, so alt-tabbing mid-run or mid-practice doesn't stall it.
- **Lossy Texture Compression** — compresses custom textures loaded from disk to cut their memory use roughly 4–8x, with a small visual quality cost. Applies to textures loaded after it's turned on.
- **Fast Bloom** — forces the game's bloom post-process onto its cheaper, lower-quality path while bloom is active. Targets real GPU work and can improve FPS on bloom-heavy levels, at the cost of softer, less precise bloom.
- **Skip No-Op Screen Filters** — skips full-screen shader passes when their current values are visually identical to doing nothing, replacing them with a plain copy. Removes real render work without changing any existing game setting.
- **Skip Redundant Screen Rescales** — the game rescales its full-screen flash quads every frame from the camera's size and aspect, even when neither has changed. This skips that frame's work whenever both match the last frame, and lets the game run normally the moment either moves.
- **Skip Idle Particle Updates** — particle decorations write their shape scale and simulation speed into the engine every frame whether or not they changed; this skips the writes while the values and the song pitch are unchanged. Paused in the editor, and re-armed whenever a particle event reloads, so nothing goes stale.
- **Pause Off-Screen Particles** — forces particle decorations to stop simulating while they're off camera, instead of the game deciding per system. Saves real CPU on particle-heavy levels, but a system that scrolls back into view resumes where it paused rather than catching up, so its timing can differ. Off by default.
- **Render All Hit Sounds** — for extremely dense charts where the game's hit-sound voices can't keep up and overlapping hits go silent: mixes all of a level's scheduled hit sounds into a continuous rendered track on a background thread and plays that instead, so none are lost. It replaces the game's own hit sounds while active and costs a little CPU and memory during play. Off by default.
