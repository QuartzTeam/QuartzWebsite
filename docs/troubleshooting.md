# Troubleshooting

## Quartz does not appear

- Confirm the zip matches your loader: `Quartz.zip` for MelonLoader, `QuartzUmm.zip` for UnityModManager.
- Confirm the loader itself is installed for A Dance of Fire and Ice.
- Restart the game after installing Quartz.

## The log says "no usable runtime — reinstall Quartz"

Some installers extract the mod folder without its `Runtime/` folder, which leaves Quartz with nothing to load. Since `v2.0.0-alpha-115` Quartz repairs this on its own: it re-downloads its own release and restores the missing runtime during startup, so the message should be followed by "the runtime was restored" in the same log and the game starts with Quartz working. If you see the error on an older build, or the restore fails because you were offline, install the latest release once by hand — extract the zip over your install (MelonLoader: over the game folder; UnityModManager: the `Quartz` folder into your mods directory) — and it will not come back.

## UnityModManager: Quartz downloads itself again on every launch

Up to `v2.0.0-alpha-124` and `v2.0.0-beta-6`, UnityModManager installs moved Quartz's `Runtime/` folder into `UserData/` at every start, so Quartz fetched its release again each launch. Update to a newer build and it stops. The old copies are left at `Mods/Quartz/UserData/Runtime/` — delete that folder by hand to get the space back. Only that one: the `Mods/Quartz/Runtime/` folder is the live install.

## The game starts but settings are missing

Open the in-game Quartz menu with the mod's keybind (default: `ALT + K`). For UMM installs, Quartz settings live in the Quartz menu rather than inside the UMM panel.

## A setting resets or goes missing after a restart

If a saved value cannot be read back — a keybind, a collapsed section, a profile's name, a stored key count — Quartz drops that one entry and keeps the rest of the file. It records what it dropped in your loader's log, so the log will name the setting rather than leaving you guessing. MelonLoader keeps its log at `MelonLoader/Latest.log` beside the game.

If the same setting keeps resetting, the log line is the thing to include when you report it.

## The game keeps loading an old version

Restart Steam and confirm only one Quartz package is installed. Remove any leftover `Koren.dll` from older installs — Quartz migrates old Koren data automatically, but the old DLL itself should not stay loaded.

## A fix shipped but the feature still behaves the old way

Compare the module's version, shown on its row under **Modules → All Modules**, with the Quartz version on **Home**. Builds up to `v2.0.0-alpha-102` wrote a module into your install only once, so a module could sit several builds behind the mod around it and never receive a fix that shipped inside it.

`v2.0.0-alpha-103` and newer refresh your modules whenever Quartz updates. The repair lives in the mod rather than in the modules, though, so an install that is already behind catches up on the update *after* the one that brings it in. To fix a single module right away, **Remove** it and install it again — the copy inside your download goes back in, with your settings intact.

## A module offers an update to an older version

If a row reads `v2.0.0-alpha-103` with an update waiting for `v2.0.0-alpha-102`, the module list is comparing against a catalog that has fallen behind your install. On `v2.0.0-alpha-103` this offer was real and taking it put the older file back, so leave it alone and update Quartz itself to `v2.0.0-alpha-104` or newer, where only a genuinely newer build is ever offered.

Press **Refresh** on **Modules → All Modules** to pull the catalog again if a row still looks wrong afterwards.

## Quartz did not update itself at launch

Since `v2.0.0-alpha-113`, Quartz checks for a new release when the game starts and loads it in the same launch. If a release is out but you are still on the old build:

- Coming from a build older than `v2.0.0-alpha-113`, the first restart after updating runs your previous version one last time while the new layout takes over — restart once more.
- The launch check follows the channel picker under **Updates** in **Settings**, and it never installs a release you chose **Skip** on.
- If you were offline (or GitHub was slow) at launch, the game starts on your current version and tries again next time.
- A build that failed to start on your machine is rolled back and held back on purpose; it is retried when the next release comes out.
- Check `UserData/Quartz/Runtime/update.json` (UnityModManager: `Quartz/Runtime/update.json`) — `"Enabled": false` there switches the launch check off.

## The in-app updater never offers a new build

Start with the channel picker at the top of **Updates** in **Settings**. The updater only offers builds from the channel you picked and the stabler ones above it, so a **Stable** setting stays quiet for as long as only prereleases are being published.

Builds up to `v2.0.0-alpha-98` also had a bug here: picking **Alpha** could still install `v2.0.0-beta-1`, and once that was on disk nothing newer was ever offered. To get out, set the channel to **Beta** and update once — `v2.0.0-beta-2` carries the fix — then set it back to **Alpha**. Installing the newest build by hand from the releases page works just as well.

## The in-app updater reports a verification failure

Quartz checks a downloaded update's checksum before installing it, so a corrupted or interrupted download won't be applied. Just try updating again; if it keeps failing, download the release manually from the releases page below and install it the normal way.

## A download link is blocked

Use the latest build's page directly:

```text
https://github.com/PrismMods/Quartz/releases/tag/latest-alpha
```

## A level refuses to load because it requires mods

A Dance of Fire and Ice blocks any level that lists required mods, whether or not you actually have them. With Quartz installed, a level like this loads as long as every mod it lists is present; the block only remains when one of them is genuinely missing, and the level's error still names what it needs.

## Getting a more detailed log

Quartz suppresses errors it can safely recover from, so they stay out of your log by default. To record them anyway, set `QUARTZ_DIAG=1` in the environment the game launches from, then reproduce the problem:

```text
QUARTZ_DIAG=1
```

!!! tip

    Turn it on only while chasing a problem. It makes the log noisier, and every line it adds is something Quartz already handled.

## Still stuck?

Ask in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/mAzAghu5Xq) or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/PrismMods/Quartz/issues). A log captured with `QUARTZ_DIAG=1` set is the most useful thing you can attach.
